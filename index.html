        <h2>
          The Peaceful Revolutionary in Charge of Ending 48 Years of Tirany
        </h2>
        <p>
          In Portugal, 1974, the MFA, an organization of lower ranked officers
          within the Portuguese Armed Forces enacted a coup which brought down
          the longest running authoritarian regime in Western Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Commanded by MFA leadership, Captain Salgueiro Maia was tasked to take
          and hold the government quarter in Lisbon. From the School of Cavalry,
          in Santar√©m, in the early hours of 25th of April 1974, Salgueiro Maia
          turned to his men in the morning assembly:
        </p>
        <p id="speech">
          <em
            >"Gentlemen, as you all know, there are various forms of state. The
            welfare states, the capitalist states and the state we are in. Now,
            in this solemn night, we are going to end this state! So that anyone
            who wants to come with me, we go to Lisbon and finish it. This is
            voluntary. Who does not want to leave, stay here!"</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          All of them formed up and went to Lisbon. Throughout the day, facing
          many times the possibility of clashes between the revolutionaries and
          the forces of the regime, Salgueiro Maia was able to keep the
          revolution from turning bloody, often by putting himself in jeopardy.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, the carnation revolution would achieve its goal without
          the revolutionaries having killed anyone. Four civilians were shot
          dead by government forces, who were later arrested by the MFA for
          their murders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Salgueiro Maia continued to serve in the military, later getting a
          degree in Political and Social Sciences. He died from cancer, age 47,
          in 1992.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the Portuguese, who owe him a great debt, and to those who love
          liberty, Salgueiro Maia is a high example of that always dignified and
          worthy pursuit. A true Captain of April, always.
        </p>
